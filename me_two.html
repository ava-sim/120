  <h2>My most recent trip</h2>
  <p>This past semester I studied abroad in Hong Kong. I attended the University of Hong Kong;
    I also spend a lot of time traveling around Asia and went to the Phillipines, Thailand,
    Vietnam, Beijing, Shanghai, and South Korea. I had an amazing time and learned a lot about 
    Hong Kong culture and food! In two weeks I will also be heading to Croatia and it will be my 
    first time in Europe. Let me know if you have a recs! </p>

  <h2> Favorite Restaurant </h2>
  <p> My favorite restaurant is located in Philadelphia and is called <a href="https://www.sampanphilly.com/" target="_blank">Graffiti Bar</a>.
  The owner has a few restaurant in the area and they have a lot of yummy small bites such as their edamame dumplings (surprising but very good), 
  dan dan dumpling, and tuna rice crackers. The service is very good and it's close to city hall. </p>

    <div class="column">
      One of my favorite foods is a Korean food called galbi. It's beef short ribs and marinated in a sauce and then barbecued. I usually eat it alongside 
      rice and kimchi. Sometimes I wrap it in letucce and add a spicy sauce.
